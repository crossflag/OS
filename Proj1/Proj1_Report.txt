********************************************
The program "Pair War" is a POSIX thread showcase. The program takes in an argument value seed in the command line
After seed input the deck is randomized and shuffled then the program creates 4 threads; 3 players and 1 dealer.
The threads then instantiate turns and run through three rounds of the Pair War game. Each round a player draws and discards a card
until one player draws a pair. After a winner is declared then the next round starts and the dealer thread reshuffles and deals again
and the game continues until three rounds are reached.

In order to run the program must be compiled as such "g++ dsp50_m_e172.cpp -pthread" when compiled it returns an executable
this is run as "/a.out seed" with seed being a number of choice by the user in the range of 0 - 52.
